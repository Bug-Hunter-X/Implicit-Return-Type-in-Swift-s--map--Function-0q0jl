This repository showcases a common error in Swift's `map` function related to implicit return types. The `bug.swift` file demonstrates the issue, while `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected code.  The problem arises from the compiler's inability to automatically infer the return type in certain scenarios, leading to potential unexpected behavior. The solution explicitly specifies the return type in the closure, ensuring type safety and correct functionality.
